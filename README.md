# Interactive CDC Clear Communication Index
This is an interactive version of the [CDC's Clear Communication Index](https://www.cdc.gov/ccindex/index.html). The Clear Communication Index is a helpful tool: it's an index of evidence-based methods to create more effective health communication material. But, I don't like using the PDF to score items - so I built [this one-page app instead](https://mmontesanonyc.github.io/interactive-CDC-CCI/). 

It uses [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and vanilla JavaScript, and is based on my similar interactive version of a [Data Visualization Checklist](https://github.com/mmontesanonyc/interactive-evergreen-checklist).
