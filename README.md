# Interactive CDC Clear Communication Index
This is an interactive version of the [CDC's Clear Communication Index](https://www.cdc.gov/ccindex/index.html). The Clear Communication Index is a helpful tool: it's an index of evidence-based methods to create more effective health communication material. 

But, I don't like using the PDF to score items - so I built this one-page app instead. It uses [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and vanilla JavaScript. 

This is based on my similar interactive version of the [Evergreen Data Vis Checklist](https://stephanieevergreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/EvergreenDataVizChecklist.pdf), which you can use [here](https://mmontesanonyc.github.io/interactive-evergreen-checklist/).
